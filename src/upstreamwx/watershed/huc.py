"""lat/lon -> containing HUC-12 via live USGS WBD (PRD FR-2).

Primary path: the HyRiver ``pynhd.WaterData`` "wbd12" layer, a point spatial
query against the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset served from
hydro.nationalmap.gov. Falls back to the "wbd10" (HUC-10) layer if no HUC-12
covers the point.

The WBD attribute names are lowercase (``huc12``, ``tohuc``, ``areasqkm``); we
still normalise field lookups defensively so this keeps working if the service
casing changes.

    Constructing a ``WaterData`` performs a one-off WFS service handshake against
    the USGS GeoServer (~1.5 s, *not* covered by HyRiver's response cache). A
    single upstream trace touches the same few layers (``wbd12``/``wbd10``/
    ``wbd8``…) up to three times — once to resolve the containing HUC, once to
    fetch the surrounding region, once to probe for external inflow — so we
    memoise the client per layer to pay the handshake once per process. This
    removes ~3 s from every cold HUC trace (FR-2, NFR-6). The client is a thin,
    stateless query wrapper (each ``bygeom``/``byfilter`` is independent), so
    reuse is safe. The import stays lazy here to keep ``pynhd`` off the import
    path for offline, fixture-only work.
