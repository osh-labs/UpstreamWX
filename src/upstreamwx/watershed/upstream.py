"""Upstream contributing-watershed trace (PRD FR-3).

Given a containing HUC-12 (:class:`~upstreamwx.watershed.huc.HucResult`),
deterministically collect every HUC-12 that drains *into* it and dissolve their
boundaries into a single upstream domain polygon. This polygon is the
aggregation domain consumed by the SREF processor (Spike A).

Primary method (``tohuc-graph``):
  Each WBD HUC-12 carries a ``tohuc`` attribute naming the HUC-12 immediately
  downstream of it. We fetch every HUC-12 in the surrounding HU8 (widening to
  HU6 if the origin sits near an HU8 edge), build a directed graph of
  downstream->upstream edges with networkx, and collect all descendants of the
  origin. This is order-independent and fully reproducible given a WBD snapshot.

Fallback method (``nldi-ut``):
  If the WBD attribute walk yields nothing usable, navigate upstream
  tributaries from the nearest NHDPlus flowline via the USGS NLDI service and
  aggregate the returned basin geometry.

Areas are computed in EPSG:5070 (CONUS Albers equal-area).
