"""Server-side PDF export via headless Chromium / Playwright (FR-27).

Renders the existing print-optimised template (frontend/pdf/briefing-pdf.html) with
the live structured briefing injected as ``window.__BRIEFING__``, bypassing the browser
print dialog entirely.  The caller receives raw PDF bytes suitable for streaming back
as ``application/pdf``.

Why headless render instead of a pure-Python PDF library:
  The template already contains the complete, reviewed layout (running footer on every
  page, severity colour ladder, mission metadata, phase breakdown, hourly table, source
  drill-down, reference-only disclaimer).  Replicating that in a library would duplicate
  and inevitably drift.  Rendering the template guarantees PDF and PWA/print views stay
  in sync with zero extra maintenance surface.
