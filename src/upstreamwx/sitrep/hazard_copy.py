"""User-facing per-hazard threshold-logic copy for the PWA Hazards view (FR-20, §6.8).

The Hazards view shows, per hazard, the *definition* of the tier ladder behind the
posture so a trip leader can see how the number was reached and verify it (FR-20, the
"how this is calculated" requirement). This is descriptive prose — it cites Appendix B
section numbers per the repo's docstring-citation convention — and is **not** a threshold
cut point: the actual numbers remain data in ``data/thresholds/*.yaml`` (FR-20a). The
frontend strips the parenthetical citations before display (``thresholdLogicHtml``).

Posture, drivers, confidence, and assumptions are all produced by the deterministic
engine and serialized live; only this static framing copy lives here.
