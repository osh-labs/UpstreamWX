"""Refresh-cycle arithmetic aligned to the GEFS/REFS + AFD update cadence (PRD FR-12).

Briefings are cached and regenerated on the model cycle, not per request, so reopening
the app costs nothing (PRD §7, §11). GEFS and REFS both run every six hours at
00/06/12/18Z; AFDs are issued roughly twice daily and updated as needed, comfortably
inside that cadence. The scheduler anchors to these boundaries. Note that cache
*validity* is keyed to the newest cycle actually **available** (publication lags the
boundary by hours — see ``BriefingService._cycle_token``); the wall-clock ``cycle_key``
here is only its last-resort fallback and the scheduler's timing source.

Pure datetime math — no I/O — so it is deterministic and unit-testable. The always-on
scheduler that *acts* on these boundaries is host-dependent (EC2) and lives in
:mod:`upstreamwx.api.scheduler`; persisting the cache across restarts is M0.1.1 work.
