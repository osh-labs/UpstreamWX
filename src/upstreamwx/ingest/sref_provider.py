"""SREF provider — ensemble probability over the upstream domain (FR-7).

Thin wrapper over the M0.0 SREF pipeline (``upstreamwx.sref``): find the latest
cycle, subset the probability fields, filter to the steps that overlap the mission
window, and aggregate the conservative max over the upstream watershed polygon.
The ensemble probability is itself the fraction of members exceeding the threshold,
so it doubles as the member-support input for the confidence qualifier (§16.5).

Reads through the persistent cycle cache (:mod:`upstreamwx.sref.cache`, M0.1.1): the
first access to a cycle downloads the CONUS subset, every later domain — and any access
after a restart — aggregates from the cached grid. The scheduler warms that cache on the
SREF cadence (:func:`upstreamwx.api.service.BriefingService.warm_and_prune`).
