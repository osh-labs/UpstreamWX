"""GEFS provider — global ensemble over the upstream domain via in-house member exceedance (FR-7).

The SREF-replacement sibling of :mod:`upstreamwx.ingest.refs_provider`. GEFS ships **per-member
grids only** (no probability product), so this provider computes ``P(field > threshold)`` itself
as the **member-exceedance fraction** over the upstream domain — the value SREF's ``ensprod`` used
to hand us pre-baked. Member fetches are **fanned across a thread pool** (Spike F found a 31-member
sequential fetch overruns the per-call budget; ~16-way concurrency keeps it in budget).

GEFS has **no native thunderstorm-probability field**, so the lightning signal
(``gefs_p_tstm``) is a derived **convective proxy**: the per-member co-occurrence of instability
(CAPE) and precip over the Lightning Area of Concern. REFS (3 km) is authoritative for the same-day
lightning/flash-flood posture; GEFS is the coarse backstop beyond REFS range (the engine takes the
higher tier where both are in range, FR-19).
