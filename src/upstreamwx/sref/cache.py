"""Persistent, cycle-keyed on-disk cache for SREF probability subsets (roadmap §M0.1.1).

The PRD's SREF processor is a *scheduled* backend that pulls each cycle once and serves
every active domain from the cached grid (PRD §7, §11.2, FR-7, FR-12). The M0.1 on-demand
path (:mod:`upstreamwx.sref.extract`) re-downloads a byte-range subset on every call into a
throwaway tempdir, so nothing survives within a process — let alone across the restart the
always-on EC2 host must tolerate. This module is the deferred persistence layer: it mirrors
the watershed on-disk cache (:mod:`upstreamwx.watershed.cache`), keying decoded SREF grids
by cycle under ``Settings.data_dir / "sref"`` so a cycle's CONUS subset is fetched once and
reused — by later requests *and* after a restart — while NOMADS still retains it (~2 days,
see :mod:`upstreamwx.sref.sources`).

What is cached is the byte-range subset ``.grib2`` itself, re-decoded with cfgrib on a hit.
That keeps the on-demand output bit-for-bit identical (the decode is the same one the live
path runs) and needs no new serialization. Writes are atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``)
so a partial or failed download (NFR-6 degradation) never leaves a poisoned cache entry and
a concurrent reader sees either no file or the complete one.
