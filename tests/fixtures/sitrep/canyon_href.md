## BLUF

**OVERALL POSTURE: High**  ·  Confidence: Moderate

| Hazard | Posture | Confidence | Window of concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flash flood | High | Moderate | 2026-06-20 09:00–2026-06-20 17:00 |
| Lightning | High | Moderate | 2026-06-20 08:00–2026-06-20 09:00 |
| Heat | Extreme Caution | Moderate | 2026-06-20 08:00–2026-06-20 09:00 |
| Cold/wet (assumes wet egress) | Minimal | Moderate | — |

## PHASE BREAKDOWN

### Approach (2026-06-20 08:00–2026-06-20 09:00)
- Lightning: High
- Heat: Extreme Caution (primary)
- Cold/wet: Minimal

### Technical span (2026-06-20 09:00–2026-06-20 17:00)
- Flash flood: High
- Heat: Extreme Caution (primary)
- Cold/wet: Minimal

### Egress (2026-06-20 17:00–2026-06-20 18:00)
- Lightning: High
- Cold/wet: Minimal (primary)
- Heat: Extreme Caution

## KEY DRIVERS (per active hazard)

### Flash flood
- SREF P(precip/thunder) 65% ≥ 60% over upstream domain
- HREF neighborhood P(QPF) 45% concurs at High

### Lightning
- SREF P(tstm) 50% ≥ 40%
- SPC slight risk over window
- AFD mentions isolated/scattered afternoon convection
- HREF neighborhood P(convection) 35% ≥ 30% (~3 km same-day)
- CAPE 1200 J/kg (moderate instability) — context only.

### Heat
- Heat index 95 °F → Extreme Caution
- Approach involves exertion under load: effective heat strain runs one category hotter than the ambient heat index suggests.

### Cold/wet
- Apparent temperature 92 °F (wet-party basis)
- Assumes a wet party on egress (FR-16).
