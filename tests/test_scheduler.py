"""Scheduler event-loop hygiene tests (C-3, FR-12).

``BriefingService.warm_and_prune`` / ``refresh_active`` are synchronous, network/GRIB-heavy
calls that can run for minutes on a cold cycle. Run inline in :func:`run_scheduler` they
starved the asyncio event loop — ``/v1/health`` and every briefing request froze for the
whole pass. These tests pin the fix (each pass dispatched via ``asyncio.to_thread``), the
loop's survive-a-bad-cycle semantics, and the lifespan shutdown timeout that keeps a
blocked pass from hanging process exit.
