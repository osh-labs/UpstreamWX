# UpstreamWX — UI Style Guide (Source of Truth)

This is the **visual source of truth** for the UpstreamWX PWA. The PRD (§6.8,
Appendix D §18) governs *behavior, content, and information architecture*; this
document governs *how it looks* — the dark briefing chrome, the design tokens,
and the component patterns derived from the reference mockups and adapted to the
PRD.

> **Precedence.** Where this guide and the PRD disagree on *what* is shown or
> *how it behaves*, the PRD wins. Where the PRD is silent on a *visual* detail
> (a color value, a radius, a spacing step), this guide is authoritative. The
> tokens here are mirrored exactly in [`styles/tokens.css`](styles/tokens.css) —
> change them in both places, or treat the CSS as generated from this table.

## 1. Design principles

1. **Dark, glanceable, field-oriented.** The chrome is a low-light "weather
   briefing" surface meant to be read on a phone at a trailhead in bright sun or
   at night. High contrast for posture/severity; quiet chrome everywhere else.
2. **BLUF first.** The most consequential information — overall posture, the
   four hazards, confidence — is the largest and highest-contrast thing on the
   Overview. Drill-down detail is quieter and one tap away (FR-22).
3. **Severity is the only loud color.** Color carries meaning (the severity
   ladder, FR-35). Chrome is neutral so that a red Extreme bar is never
   competing with decorative color.
4. **Reference-only, never a verdict.** No go/no-go, no "all clear," no green
   "all systems go" affordance (FR-39). Status chrome describes **data
   currency** ("Briefing current as of …"), not a recommendation. The
   reference-only disclaimer is persistent, not dismissible (FR-40).
5. **Confidence is always visible.** Every posture carries its confidence —
   as timeline hatching *and* an explicit label — and is never collapsed to a
   single mission number (FR-36).
6. **Honest about assumptions.** Inferred phases, wet-egress, cave-isolation,
   and slot-shelter assumptions are surfaced in-line, not hidden (FR-9a, §10).

### 1.1 User-facing copy rules

These apply to **copy that ships in the UI** (labels, summaries, cards, the
About page, disclaimers). They do not apply to this document or other internal
docs, which may cite requirements freely.

- **No requirement citations in user-facing copy.** Never surface `FR-xx`,
  `NFR-x`, `§n`, or "Appendix B" to a user. They are internal traceability and
  read as clutter. Explain the behavior in plain language instead; keep the
  requirement reference in code comments or commit messages if needed.
- **No em-dashes (`—`) in user-facing copy.** Rewrite with a period, comma, or
  parentheses. For numeric ranges use "to" (e.g. "6 to 36 h") or an en-dash on
  units ("90–103 °F"); never an em-dash.
- **Emphasis bold is not used in body copy.** Let sentence structure carry the
  emphasis. Bold is reserved for genuine labels/headings, not for stressing a
  word mid-sentence.

## 2. Adaptations from the reference mockups

The mockups (Summit SAR) contribute **chrome and layout only**. The following
table is the authoritative diff applied in this guide and the PWA (PRD §6.8,
Appendix D, §13 "Mockup elements explicitly dropped").

| Mockup element | UpstreamWX treatment | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Summit SAR" brand + summit hex mark | **UpstreamWX** brand + upstream/water hex mark | Rebrand (FR-33 header) |
| Tabs: Overview · Forecast · Map Layers · Hazards · Resources | **Overview · Forecast · Map · Hazards · Resources** | FR-32 five-view IA |
| Severity legend Low / Moderate / Elevated / Extreme | **Minimal / Elevated / High / Extreme** ladder | FR-35 (mockup legend dropped) |
| Hazards: High Winds, Icing, Blowing Snow, Rough Terrain, … | **Flash flood · Lightning · Heat · Cold/wet** only | FR-14 four-hazard set |
| Timeline keyed to wall-clock only | **Phase-primary** (approach → technical → egress), wall-clock secondary | FR-34 |
| "OVERALL RISK — MODERATE" verdict chip | **"OVERALL POSTURE"** shown as information, never a recommendation | FR-39 |
| "All Systems Go" footer status | **"Briefing current as of <time>"** (data currency) | FR-39 |
| "Add as Alert" / push notifications | **Removed** | Out of scope (§13) |
| Radar / nowcast map layer | **Removed**; map shows **upstream watershed overlay** + alert polygons + point conditions | FR-38 |
| Multi-waypoint route on map | **Single free-form mission point** | FR-1 |
| Heat as a generic colored bar | Heat uses its **NWS categories** (Caution → Extreme Danger) | FR-15 |
| (absent) confidence rendering | **Solid vs. hatched** bars + explicit High/Mod/Low label | FR-36 |
| (absent) reference-only disclaimer | **Persistent** footer on Overview and every briefing surface | FR-40 |
| (absent) offline/cached state | **Cached badge + generation timestamp** when offline | FR-41 |

## 3. Color tokens

All values are dark-theme. CSS variable names match
[`styles/tokens.css`](styles/tokens.css) exactly.

### 3.1 Surfaces & chrome

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg` | `#0a0e14` | App background (deepest layer) |
| `--color-surface` | `#11161f` | Cards, tab bar, header |
| `--color-surface-2` | `#1a212d` | Nested/raised panels, metric cards |
| `--color-surface-3` | `#232d3b` | Hover, pressed, active rows |
| `--color-border` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` | Hairline card/divider borders |
| `--color-border-strong` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.16)` | Emphasized borders, focus rings base |
| `--color-overlay` | `rgba(8,11,16,0.72)` | Map card scrims, modals |

### 3.2 Text

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-text` | `#e6edf3` | Primary text, values |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#9aa7b8` | Labels, secondary copy |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#5f6b7c` | Captions, timestamps, axis ticks |
| `--color-text-inverse` | `#0a0e14` | Text on solid severity / brand fills |

### 3.3 Brand

UpstreamWX reads "water / upstream"; the accent is a river cyan, deliberately
distinct from the mockups' summit amber.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-brand` | `#38bdf8` | Logo mark, active tab indicator, links |
| `--color-brand-strong` | `#0ea5e9` | Pressed brand, focus ring |
| `--color-brand-dim` | `rgba(56,189,248,0.14)` | Active tab wash, link hover bg |

### 3.4 Severity ladder (FR-35) — the only semantic color set

Minimal = green, Elevated = amber, High = orange, Extreme = red. Each tier has a
**solid** fill (bars, chips), a **wash** (chip/row backgrounds), and a **text**
tone (on dark surfaces). Persistence (FR-37) is encoded by bar *length*, not
color; confidence (FR-36) by *hatching*, not color.

| Tier | `--sev-*` (solid) | `--sev-*-wash` | `--sev-*-text` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimal** | `#3fb950` | `rgba(63,185,80,0.16)` | `#56d364` |
| **Elevated** | `#d9a514` | `rgba(217,165,20,0.16)` | `#e3b341` |
| **High** | `#f0883e` | `rgba(240,136,62,0.16)` | `#f0a763` |
| **Extreme** | `#f85149` | `rgba(248,81,73,0.18)` | `#ff7b72` |

### 3.5 Heat — NWS Heat Index categories (FR-15)

Heat does **not** use the four-tier ladder; it uses the NWS categories directly.
Distinct ramp so heat is not confused with the severity tiers.

| NWS category | Token | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Caution | `--heat-caution` | `#e3c01a` |
| Extreme Caution | `--heat-ext-caution` | `#f0a020` |
| Danger | `--heat-danger` | `#ec6a2c` |
| Extreme Danger | `--heat-ext-danger` | `#da3633` |

### 3.6 Confidence (FR-36)

Confidence is rendered by **fill style**, not hue, so it never competes with
severity color:

- **High** — solid fill, full opacity.
- **Moderate** — solid fill at `--confidence-mod-opacity` (`0.82`).
- **Low** — **hatched** fill (`--confidence-hatch`), the mockups' "possible"
  treatment, repurposed as the ensemble-spread cue.

```
--confidence-hatch: repeating-linear-gradient(
  -45deg, transparent 0 5px, rgba(255,255,255,0.22) 5px 7px );
```

The explicit label (High / Moderate / Low) always accompanies the visual cue in
hazard detail.

### 3.7 Utility / feedback

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-info` | `#58a6ff` | Informational chips, links in body |
| `--color-warn` | `#d9a514` | Degraded-source / assumption notices (NFR-6) |
| `--color-offline` | `#bc8cff` | Cached/offline badge (FR-41) — not a severity hue |
| `--color-success` | `#3fb950` | Form validation only — **never** a posture verdict |

---

## 4. Typography

**Albert Sans** (body + headings) and **Ubuntu Mono** (all monospace) — vendored,
exact-pinned webfonts served same-origin (`frontend/vendor/fonts/`, `landing/vendor/fonts/`;
same self-hosting rationale as the map libraries, SA-05: no CDN dependency, precached by
the service worker, installs and renders offline). Albert Sans ships as a single variable
font (weight range 100–900, `@font-face` in `tokens.css`) so the type scale's
non-multiple-of-100 weights (620, 650) render at their exact value rather than snapping to
a static face; Ubuntu Mono ships as static 400/700 faces. Both fall back to the system stack
below if a font file fails to load. Tabular/monospace numerals for all weather values so
columns align.

| Token | Stack |
|---|---|
| `--font-sans` | `"Albert Sans", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` |
| `--font-mono` | `"Ubuntu Mono", ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "Roboto Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace` |

### Type scale

| Token | Size / line | Weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--text-display` | 28 / 34 px | 700 | Big metric values (temp) |
| `--text-h1` | 22 / 28 px | 650 | Mission title |
| `--text-h2` | 17 / 24 px | 620 | Section / card headers |
| `--text-body` | 15 / 22 px | 400 | Body copy, summary |
| `--text-label` | 13 / 18 px | 500 | Field labels, tab labels |
| `--text-caption` | 11 / 16 px | 600 | Eyebrow labels (MISSION), timestamps; uppercase, `--tracking-wide` |

`--tracking-wide: 0.06em` for eyebrow/caption uppercase labels.

---

## 5. Spacing, radius, elevation, motion

**Spacing** — 4 px base scale: `--space-1: 4px` … `--space-2: 8`, `--space-3: 12`,
`--space-4: 16`, `--space-5: 24`, `--space-6: 32`, `--space-8: 48`.

**Radius** — `--radius-sm: 6px` (chips, inputs), `--radius-md: 10px` (bars,
buttons), `--radius-lg: 14px` (cards), `--radius-pill: 999px`.

**Elevation** — flat by default; depth via surface step + hairline border, not
heavy shadow. `--shadow-card: 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.03) inset, 0 2px 8px
rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`. `--shadow-pop: 0 8px 28px rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` for map cards/menus.

**Motion** — `--ease: cubic-bezier(0.2,0.6,0.2,1)`; `--dur-fast: 120ms`,
`--dur: 200ms`. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. A subtle, fixed baseline of
transitions is applied (no user knob): on tab switch the outgoing view is
replaced and the incoming view slides in (from the right moving forward through
the tab order, from the left moving back) with its cards fading up in a short
stagger; the tab underline is a single indicator that slides between tabs; the
header lifts a drop-shadow once the view body scrolls; the collapse chevrons
rotate 180°. Two live accents: the overall/hero posture chip pulses slowly on
the Extreme/High tiers only (never the smaller per-hazard chips), and the header
reload icon spins for a beat on tap. Every one of these is inside a
`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` guard — reduced-motion users get the
plain, instant UI. Transition-length motion stays within the 120–200 ms band;
the chip pulse is a slow ambient accent (~2.4 s), not a transition.

**Focus** — visible 2 px ring: `outline: 2px solid var(--color-brand-strong);
outline-offset: 2px`. Never remove focus outlines.

---

## 6. Layout & breakpoints

Mobile-first; the mockups are phone portrait. The shell is a single column that
caps width on larger screens.

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--app-max-width` | `480px` | Content column cap (phone-faithful) |
| `--bp-md` | `768px` | Tablet: roomier padding, 2-up metric grid stays |
| `--bp-lg` | `1024px` | Desktop: center the column, dim gutters |

Structure (all views share it):

```
┌ Header (sticky)  brand · mission title · cave/canyon · overall posture
├ Tab bar (sticky) Overview · Forecast · Map · Hazards · Resources
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ View body (scrolls)
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
└ Disclaimer footer (persistent) + data-currency / offline status
```

## 7. Components

Each component below is implemented in [`styles/app.css`](styles/app.css) under
the noted class. Visual contract first; PRD reference in parentheses.

### 7.1 App header (`.app-header`) — FR-33, Appendix D §18.1
- Left: hex mark + `UpstreamWX` wordmark.
- Center/left: mission title (editable affordance — pencil) + window line.
- Right: **cave/canyon** indicator and the **overall posture** chip (info only).
- Sticky; `--color-surface` with bottom hairline.

### 7.2 Tab bar (`.tab-bar`) — FR-32
- Five equal tabs. Active tab: `--color-brand` label + 2 px brand underline +
  `--color-brand-dim` wash. Inactive: `--color-text-secondary`.
- Sticky beneath header. Icons optional; labels mandatory (glanceable).

### 7.3 Mission card (`.mission-card`) — Appendix D §18.1
- Eyebrow `MISSION` (caption), title, date + window, location/HUC line.
- Right column: `OVERALL POSTURE` eyebrow + severity chip + confidence label.
- **No verdict language** (FR-39).

### 7.4 Posture chip (`.posture-chip`) — FR-35
- Pill, severity `--sev-*-wash` background, `--sev-*-text` text, optional solid
  dot. Sizes: `.is-lg` (header/overview), default (inline).
- Heat variant uses the heat ramp + the NWS category label.

### 7.5 Confidence bar (`.confidence`) — FR-36
- Three **equal-height** bars (not stair-stepped) plus the small gray label
  `High|Moderate|Low confidence`. Default is a compact inline row — label left,
  bars right — centered under the posture pill. The **hero** variant
  (`.is-lg`, the overall-posture card only) uses larger bars stacked above the
  label, centered under the pill.
- The filled *count* reads the engine's level: Low = 1 filled, Moderate = 2,
  High = all 3. Fill is **neutral** (`--color-text-secondary` filled,
  `--color-border-strong` empty) — never a severity hue, so confidence is read
  from **shape, not color** (FR-36) and can never be mistaken for a hazard tier.
- Non-interactive — set by the engine.

### 7.6 Metric card (`.metric-card`) — Appendix D §18.2
- Grid of glanceable cards: label (caption), big value (`--text-display`, mono),
  unit + secondary (feels-like / gust / chance). 2-up on phones.

### 7.7 Hazard line (`.hazard-line`) — FR-22 item 1 / Overview
- One row per hazard: icon, name, posture chip, confidence tag, window-of-concern
  (shown for Elevated+). Tappable → Hazards detail.

### 7.8 Phase strip (`.phase-strip`) — FR-14b, Appendix D §18.2
- Three segments: Approach → Technical span → Egress, with the
  **phase-weighted thermal hazard leading** each (heat↑ approach, cold↑ egress).
- Cave technical span renders **flash flood only** with an "isolated from surface
  weather" note (FR-14c).

### 7.9 Hazard timeline / Gantt (`.timeline`) — FR-34, FR-35, FR-36, FR-37
The defining drill-down visual. **Phase-primary**:
- **Rows** = hazards; **column groups** = phases (approach/technical/egress);
  a secondary wall-clock axis runs beneath.
- **Bar color** = severity (`--sev-*`).
- **Bar length** = persistence: full-period (persistent) vs. windowed (FR-37) —
  *length only, never a different color*.
- **Bar fill** = confidence: solid (High/Mod) vs. hatched (Low) (FR-36).
- A hazard appears **only in phases where it applies** (FR-14a): no lightning bar
  across a canyon technical span; a cave technical span shows flash flood only.
- Legend shows the four tiers + the solid/hatched confidence key. **No**
  Low/Moderate/Elevated/Extreme mockup legend.

### 7.10 Hazard detail row (`.hazard-detail`) — Appendix D §18.5
- Expandable. Header: hazard + posture chip + confidence tag.
- Body: key drivers, explicit confidence label, the relevant threshold logic
  (Appendix B), and stated assumptions (wet-egress / cave-isolation / slot).

### 7.10a Hazard series chart (`lineChart` in a `.hazard-detail__body`) — FR-20
- Each hazard detail card renders an inline-SVG line graph of that hazard's driving
  quantity over the shared mission clock (`forecast_hourly.hours`), read from the
  `series` block on the `hazard_detail`. Flash flood / lightning plot **probability
  (%)**; heat / cold plot an **index value (°F)**.
- **Line color = the hazard's tier token** (`--sev-*` matching `severity_class`).
  **Exception:** heat draws *over* its translucent heat-ramp bands, so its line uses
  the strong contrasting `--sev-high` rather than a `--heat-*` token that would blend
  into its own shading.
- **Threshold bands** (heat / cold only) fill horizontal rects behind the line with the
  band's own token (`--heat-*` for heat, `--sev-*` for cold) at `fill-opacity 0.16`,
  clipped to the plot's y-range. **No new colors** are invented — bands reuse §3.4 /
  §3.5 tokens.
- **Overlay** (flash flood only): the ensemble probability is the bold/opaque primary
  line; the hourly-precip secondary is faint (thinner, `opacity 0.5`, dashed,
  `--color-text-muted`).
- A **`null` value is a data gap** — the line breaks (never drawn as 0).
- **Caption required** (accessibility §9 — never color alone): every chart is paired
  with a `.chart-caption` naming the quantity + unit, the band labels, the ensemble vs
  hourly distinction, and a note that ensemble series are coarser resolution. Charts
  are self-contained inline SVG built from same-origin `app.js` (attributes only, no
  `<style>`/`<script>` blocks) so they satisfy the SA-05 strict `script-src 'self'` CSP.

### 7.11 Map card (`.map-card`) — Appendix D §18.4
- Map fills the view; the **upstream watershed overlay** is the hero layer
  (`--sev-elevated`/brand tinted polygon). A floating **point-conditions callout**
  card (`--shadow-pop`, `--color-overlay` scrim) shows temp/wind/precip at the
  pin. Alert polygons use severity color at low opacity. **No radar, no routes.**

### 7.12 Source / resource link (`.resource-link`) — Appendix D §18.6
- Row with label, source provenance, external-link affordance. Verify-against-NWS
  links (AFD, alerts, model source), PDF export action, "how this is calculated."

### 7.13 Disclaimer footer (`.disclaimer`) — FR-40
- Persistent, non-dismissible. `--color-text-secondary`, top hairline, slightly
  inset. Carries Appendix C §17.2 copy verbatim.

### 7.14 Status / currency line (`.status-line`) — FR-39, FR-41
- "Briefing current as of <time>" by default. When serving a cached briefing
  offline: prepend the **cached badge** (`--color-offline`) and show the
  generation timestamp (FR-41). Degraded sources (NFR-6) show a `--color-warn`
  note. Never a recommendation.

### 7.15 First-run acknowledgment (`.ack-modal`) — FR-31, Appendix C §17.1
- Full-screen modal shown once before first use; single "I understand — continue"
  action. Copy is Appendix C §17.1 verbatim. Blocks the app until acknowledged.

---

## 8. Iconography

- Line icons, 1.75 px stroke, 24 px grid, `currentColor` so they inherit text
  tone. Hazard glyphs: flash flood = wave/water, lightning = bolt, heat = sun,
  cold/wet = thermometer/snow. Implemented as inline SVG (`js/icons.js`) — no
  icon-font dependency (offline-safe).
- The brand mark is an **upstream hex** (hexagon with a converging-channels
  motif) in `--color-brand`. Provided at `icons/icon.svg` (maskable) and used for
  the PWA install icon.

---

## 9. Accessibility

- Contrast: body text ≥ 4.5:1 on its surface; severity chip text uses the
  `--sev-*-text` tone (verified ≥ 4.5:1 on `--sev-*-wash`). **Never** rely on
  color alone — severity always carries a text label, confidence always carries
  a label, persistence is a shape.
- Hit targets ≥ 44 px. Focus rings always visible (§5).
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable bar grow / tab slide transitions.
- Timeline is also exposed as a semantic list for screen readers (each hazard ×
  phase as text: hazard, phase, tier, confidence, window).

---

## 10. Tokens ↔ code mapping

- **Tokens** (§3–§6) → [`styles/tokens.css`](styles/tokens.css) `:root`.
- **Components** (§7) → [`styles/app.css`](styles/app.css).
- **Data contract** the views render → mirrors `BriefingResponse` /
  `BriefingResult` (`src/upstreamwx/api/models.py`, `engine/models.py`); the
  offline sample is [`data/sample-briefing.json`](data/sample-briefing.json).

When the backend lands (M0.4), the only change is swapping the sample fetch for
the live `POST /v1/briefing` call — the render layer and these tokens are
unchanged.
